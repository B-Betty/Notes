It is interesting to consider the difference between having a stereo camera - which is simply two cameras separated in space - and the situation in monocular SLAM where a single camera takes images from two locations, separated by time. One could argue that a monocular camera (observing a static scene) from two locations separated by some baseline would give exactly the same information as a stereo camera. Indeed, this is the case, assuming the distance the camera has moved is known: if the distance between the two camera positions is known this introduces a real scale reference just as in stereo. The crucial difference is that in general this is not known (and certainly not between every pair of camera positions during mapping), whereas in stereo the length of the fixed baseline is easily measured.
